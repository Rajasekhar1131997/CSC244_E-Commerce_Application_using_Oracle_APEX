# 🛒 E-Commerce Application using Oracle APEX

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **E-Commerce Application** built using **Oracle Application Express (APEX)** and **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**.  
The goal was to develop a **scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform** that efficiently manages orders, products, customers, and sales data.

This project demonstrates the integration of **low-code development with Oracle APEX** to enable rapid application deployment while ensuring robust database management with Oracle Autonomous DB.
